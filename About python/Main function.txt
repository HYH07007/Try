The meaning of statement:
>>> if __name__ == "__main__":
When you execute a.py, the attribution __name__ of a.py is __main__.
However, when you execute b.py and import a.py, then the attribution __name__ of a.py is a.py but not __main__.
So the statements in the module "if __name__=="__main__"" can only be executed when you execute a.py but not import it.
